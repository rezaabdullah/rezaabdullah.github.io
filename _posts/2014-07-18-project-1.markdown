description: NodeJS based IoT solution is developed to integrate low cost hardwares with industrial automation protocols such Modbus and PLC. The solution can take measurable action to reduce OPEX without altering pre existing SCADA architecture; enabling processes to be lean and agile without the overhead cost of compliance and regulations. The life-cycle of the IoT solution were developed (architecting the process and data model) and managed (prototype to production) on Google Cloud Platform. Machine Learning pipelines were implemented to automate the workflow of Data Warehousing, Model generation and deployment. Various ML/Statistical algorithms (Generalised Linear Model, Ensemble Learning and Support Vector Regression) were implemented to determine optimum outcome.
